A Wolf in Autumn,"I'd been meaning to replay this game a second time before submitting a review, mainly because of some plot developments that really demand a second viewing in order to contextualize properly the things that are happening in the game.   I did play the devs' previous games multiple times, but I have to admit, part of the reason why I'd taken so long here was because AWIA SCARES me. People may differ on what they conceive as horror, but for me, this is a horror game. Yes, it continues the sort of exploratory and puzzle style with focus on narration and story from the dev's previous games, but it is terrifying to me.  It begins with some text that appears straightforward, but then gets increasingly intense as the text screens progress, accompanied by some very aptly ominous music. And that's just the prologue before the game begins. You awaken to find yourself in a bright, oversaturated, and mesmerizing arboreal environment. And things seem pleasant again. Yeah, you're locked in a shed, but you easily get out, and you're able to communicate with your mom. But as you begin to explore your surroundings, things get more unnerving, and you find yourself feeling more vulnerable.  That's much as I can really describe of the setting without spoiling anything. The story in AWIA is a bit vague and unclear at first (and even a little after a second viewing), but it's not a disservice to the game. It's a very surreal experience, and the game does an excellent job of slowly giving more information to the player about who you are and what is going on. It's actually done very well, and adds to why the game is so scary to me. I can't really say much, but just the little bits of flavor text when you pick up certain items, or enter certain areas help to convey, although not so subtly, very organically, bits and pieces of your character (like why you can only carry one item at a time).   Speaking of flavor text, the dev mentioned to me in a previous comment how one of the things he added in The Music Machine, was a larger variety of objects in the world to interact with because he felt that it added immersion. I definitely agree, and it was one of the things I liked in TMM versus The Moon Sliver. It gets even better in this game. When you attempt to use certain objects to deal with certain puzzles, there's actually unique text describing why your item doesn't work, instead of a generic “this item does not work here”. It's great, and I could be wrong, but I think there are also different ways to solve some of the different puzzles. All this just adds to the immersion, that you really are a little girl just fumbling around trying to figure stuff out.  And as you try to figure stuff out, the game may seem a bit slow at the beginning (at least it was for me, because I could not figure out many of the puzzles without quite a bit of roaming about because the...trigger points aren't as obvious), but it's quite rewarding, and like many good horror films...it gets increasingly disturbing as you progress, until you get to the final sequence and it's just snowballing in your face.  Overally, I greatly recommend this if you're into the previous games by the dev. And even if you weren't, I feel like you might have a different opinion about this. The game is much more intense. The puzzles are much more interesting. And the voice acting is incredible (as I said, this game legitimately scares me. It's emotionally taxing for all sorts of reasons). The story and characters seem rich. I say seem, because again, it's a bit unclear. But as I said, it's not a bad thing, and I look forward to additional plays, and looking through internet discussions to piece together exactly what is going on between the girl and her mother.  The graphics are gorgeous, and very fitting as you'll find. The music is excellent as with the dev's previous works. And at the end of the day. It's cheap, it's a quick play (under an hour). If you're looking for a quick, immersive, horror experience but with more emotional and narrative substance, I'm not sure you can really do better than this.",x,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alan Wake,"I had never played Alan Wake before and after seeing it on sale during the 2014 Summer Sale I decided to invest in it. This is by far one of the greatest storylines of any PC game that I have played; the detail, concept, graphics and soundtrack compliment the plot to make it one true masterpiece. Once I had downloaded and installed the game I adjusted my settings and went in game, the twelve hours I have on this game are from me playing this game back-to-back in a single day, the second best purchase of any game in my extensive Steam library; I can't recommend this game highly enough.    Pros:     A very well optimised game, I was well below the minimum requirements and still achieved a solid 30-45FPS on low settings.     Captivating and perplex storyline that made me play the game from start to finish in a single day.     Amazing graphics even on low settings, after seeing it running on ultra at 4K resolution, it looks even more amazing.     After purchasing this game I recieved a free 320KBs MP3 copy of the soundtrack and it's absolutely astounding, the composer is to be congratulated.   Cons:     A sequel was made ( Alan Wake's American Nightmare ), but it felt more of a technical demonstration and failed to captivate me in the same way this game did.",x,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alien Swarm,"This game is freee to play so...what do you have to loose in playing it?  Nothing...other then the hours you will spend playing it. Oh yes.   For a free game this is more then worth it. It allows team work, tactics, or even the head strong rushes if you wish.  Its mostly easy to join a game with random strangers and be able to work together, as at least one person will know what they are doing.  It does best when you are in a group with your freinds. Playing, planning, and working together.  It has a number of good before game and after game features that allow you to look at how to tackle the map ahead of time.  As well as see how well you did and trace your path through the map afterwards.  A great tool to have, but often goes unused (or used to draw D**K pics) with strangers on the public servers.   Yes i recommend this game.  Best if played with your freinds.",x,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0
Alien: Isolation,"I don't normally play survival horror games, but after hearing so much praise about this game and being a fan of the original movie, I thought I'd try it out.   Now I remember why I stay away from the horror genre! This game is amazing, and true to the original 1979 movie in so many ways, but it scared the beejeezus out of me, and I found myself wanting the game to end so I could stop damaging my heart, lol.   It's hard to rate a game like this, because it is unique in a lot of ways. The story, graphics, and sound are amazing, and the detail given from the movie makes this a real treat for fans of the movie. However, the constant fear and paranoia that forced me to stay in crouch mode and constantly look over my shoulder at every little sound began to wear thin after a while.  I realized something important about myself, though. Were I ever to be in Amanda Ripley's situation on Sevastopol, I would take the easy way out and end it all before going through what she did. Yep, I'm a wimp!",x,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alien: Isolation,"The alien universe has had many developements over the years, including the many sequels to the original horror film as well as the many AVP spinoffs. However in my opinion, none has yet matched the original, claustrophobic, and truly terrifying spirit embodied by Alien. This game has taken that spirit to heart in nearly every way, reproducing the smallest details of the original film, but also changing them in the best and most subtle ways to accomodate the change in medium. There is little to explain about the mechanics of the game, other than the simple fact that you are trapped aboard a star freighter similar in design to the Nostromo with the Alien, a motion tracker, and a set of gadgets that ultimately become useless against your biggest threat as it actively learns how you play. This game has all the suspense and atmosphere of Amnesia, fast paced action and thrill of Outlast, and the amazing sci-fi soul that only the alien universe can provide. I promise that if you are a fan of the original film, this game will not disappoint you, and that you will likely die more than once while admiring the detail and atmosphere. But make no mistake, this is a horror game in the spirit of the original film... if you have no desire to feel like a member of the crew of the Nostromo as they are hunted down one by one by an invincible and deadly predator, you had better go with another game.",x,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Alpha Protocol,"Alpha Protocol is one of the most responsive RPGs I have ever played. Even as the overall plot stays on course to take you through much the same set of levels, characters and circumstances react to your actions in ways you may not even appreciate without a second playthrough. Alpha Protocol's story isn't even that interesting from a wide perspective, honestly - what makes this game amazing is all the work Obsidian put into its execution, shaping a story whose interactivity blows so many other games out of the water.  Many of the mechanics are roughly executed or even just ill-conceived, for which Alpha Protocol has been deservedly criticized. Even at release it was not a very good shooter or a very good stealth game, and those parts have certainly not improved with age. But at the end of the day, solid execution on the narrative end keeps things interesting and helps make the game more than just the sum of its parts.  If you like branching narrative in your action RPGs, then you need to see what an amazing job this game does in both making its narrative threads reactive and in tying them all together. After playing Alpha Protocol, I always wish more games were like it.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Awesomenauts,"  -Quick Review-   Awesomenauts is a 2D MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena), with a strong sense of progression, and a lot of different dynamics that can be taken into account. I don't really have anything negative to say about the game, read on if you want to know more specifics!    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  Two sides are at war, choose your awesomenaut and ship out and defeat the other team! As you would expect from a game based completely on battling there isn't much to explain about the story, there is a nice opening cinematic that has a hilarious similar to a Power Rangers episode, but other than that the game is mostly an exchange of going back and forward fighting indefinitely.   Game Play:  The controls are best explained while playing the game. the movement is ASDW, you can use W or space to jump, some characters have a double jump, some fly. You use both mouse buttons and the scroll lock click to use various abilities. The button configuration is very toned down, you're limited on what abilities you can use, and before you start the game you select the abilities you want to unlock as you play the game. Okay, now I should say something about the various characters, there are A LOT of characters which might compliment your play style. I tried them all while playing 'offline practice mode', I found my favorite character and then intended to play as that character until I became very familiar with the game. As you play through the game (even playing offline practice mode) you will received experience that will unlock new awesomenauts and abilities for your awesomenauts. This element in the game gives me a very strong sense of progression throughout the game. (coupled with getting a lot of easy-to-earn-achievements that I earned while playing offline! (Thank you for that Awesomenauts!) I keep talking about 'offline practice mode', the reason I do is because I spent a lot of time playing in this mode before starting the game. When I first played this game I tried to play it with my friend, we were both equally noobish at what was going on, I didn't even know this was a MOBA! So naturally we got ourselves massacred. :( Left a bad taste in my mouth... ...But! after I discovered offline practice mode, I learned on my own without looking up guides how I wanted to play the game. Naturally if I wanted to get better guides would help, but I like to think I'm a fairly competent gamer, playing offline let me try out various characters and strategies without dragging down my team. You can adjust the AI to make practice easier or more difficult depending on your confidence. A final note about playing through the game, you start the game out with 'solar' or 'coins', you collect more of these from killing various npc / players, as you collect more, you return to your base to purchase upgrades for your awesomenaut making him/her stronger. knowing which ones to upgrade and which ones to select take practice, guides, or strategy. Once again, if you want to actually learn the game, try out offline practice mode to see what I mean! :D    Achievements:  I got a bit ahead of myself earlier with a note about the achievements. They were mostly straightforward: Win games, play games, taunt your enemy, go on a crazy killing spree, hoard up Solar (in-game currency) and then the rest are pretty much grind grind grind. Grind creep kills, grind turret kills, grind online game wins. Most of the simple achievements are simple, most of the grinding achievements you should just play the game to enjoy the game, let those grindy achievements happen if they happen. That is Atratzu's suggestion for this game's achievements.    Price:  Awesomenauts costs $9.99, So far (08/16/14) I've played 5.7 hours. I've really enjoyed learning how the game works, but my 'value system' dictates that I need to spend at least 9 hours in the game to make it worth-my-while. I definitely think this game has that type of replay-ability. As always, I recommend buying games when they're on sale, or getting them in humble bundles, I was given this game as a gift from one of my friends (You know who you are). And we haven't gotten around to playing together, but this game would really be fun to play with friends.    Conclusion:  Coming into this review, I knew from the start that I didn't really have anything negative to say about the game. *IF* there was one thing I would like to have in the game that I didn't have, I would like to play offline practice with my friends over steam, but that doesn't take away from the game in any way. Once again, story was 'meh' but amusing, game play was 'engaging different and fun', achievements were 'okay', and the price was 'fair'. I recommend this game to anyone who likes 2D platformers, and competitive battle games. If you would like to play it sometime with me, you're welcome to do so; I intend to continue playing this game over time. I really enjoyed it.",x,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Bejeweled 3,"Good for both blowing off steam during downtime and trying to challenge yourself. I love the different modes available. They have the Zen mode! AND Zen mode allows you to change the music to relaxing noises like various nature ambiances. You can even use binaural (sp?) beats, provided that you have headphones. I haven't tried that yet.  I'm not a fan of the timed challenges, so I'm glad that they are balanced out by move limitations. Butterflies is a nice touch. Relaxing with a cute feel. Having a quest line was interesting, and provided variety. Poker is kinda fun.  Originally got it as a WildTangent demo, but didn't want to deal with the whole WildCoin stuff. My laptop forced me into Windows 8. Since it links with my Live account, I figured I'd spend the $5 there, but was disappointed to find out that it was only the partial game. Civ 5 forced me into Steam. One thing led to another, and I caught this at the beginning of a sale. Definitely happy to have the full game back.",x,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0
BioShock Remastered,"  I'l be honest when I say this, I had NO issues with the game at all, well almost. The game didn't crash, no saves got deleted, but at times the framerate in certain areas would get destroyed and drop heavily and there were some graphical issues.  I also changed the keybindings and the game thought I was using a gamepad/controller.    For a Remaster, this is lacking a bit in certain areas. The graphics are better, that's for sure but that's it.  If I had no issues with the game then why am I giving it a negative review?  Here's why: I'l say i'm in the minority or one of the lucky ones that didn't have any issues with the game but there's a lot of other people that DID and still do have major game breaking issues with this 'remaster'. Most people do let's just say.  I'm not some 12 year old kid that bends over to big companies and let's them do whatever they want.  It's a lazy bad PC port, plain and simple and it needs to be fixed. Even if I didn't have issues, that doesn't mean others didn't either.   In short: One of the lucky ones that was able to play trough the game without getting screwed over but acknowledges the issues and the fact that this is just a lazy port and needs to get fixed.   Also, to all the kids saying 'YOU GOT IT FOR FREE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN' just stop.  Just because it's free, doesn't mean it's perfect and you can't complain about it. And technically, it isn't free because most people payed for it years ago.  So get out of here with that nonsense.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Blameless,"Graphic sucks. Flashlight glitch. No alternative endings and the ending sucks also. Horor scale 1 The game is too short where you only have to exit the building. (first run 15 min) Objects are being picked but you don't have hands so they just float in mid air. A work bench excited me thinking i must craft things and so on but the only use was for the hook to open the attic, than the room was locked. Voice actor is bad, cinematics are okay. The psycho turns into thin air when cop car comes. (look behind you) The motion and clunkiness made me dizzy so it's good that the game was short.  Not recomended.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Apparently a  shotgun  an allegedly 'powerful cqc weapon' requires you to shoot an enemy in the chest at least 3 times before it kills them. the same for a ♥♥♥♥♥ headshot as well. Then someone can easily run along as happy as can be, with a pistol and 1 shot headshot you from halfway across the map. WTF?! Since when did COD, one of the greatest gaming series in history ever become so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to play. Honest to God, I beg of you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Call of Duty: World at War,"The story mode can be summarized with 'Run that way, kill those dudes, and capture the objective.' The multiplayer is typical post-Call of Duty 4 mechanics. But, come on, we all know that at this point, you're not buying this game for the story or the multiplayer. You're buying it for the Nazi Zombies. And fortunately, they're all here. Through the grace of Gaben, all the DLC is included with your game with no extra purchases required. You get all four zombie maps included and ready to play. And all the multiplayer maps too, if that's what you're into. Somehow, though, the multiplayer is still pretty smooth, with hackers being all but absent from play.  I give this game 5/5 free map packs for being functional, having a mode of play that's still likable almost six years later, and for existing before the Call of Duty franchise became synonymous with 'repetitive'.",x,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0

Farm Frenzy: Hurricane Season,"Farm Frenzy: Hurricane Season is a casual game from Buka Entertainment/Alawar. The game bears the Buka trademark cute childrens story book graphics. As is characteristic of nearly all games from this publisher the game is family friendly and well suited for younger children, but will appeal to casual game fans of all ages.  The graphics are full HD and are both cute and well animated. The artstyle is colourful and pleasing to look at.  The sound is contextual with pleasant samples. Music is sequenced sound loops in a pseudo country style arangement which is pleasing to listen to. There appears to be a single in-game track repeated during game play stages which gets a bit repetitive. The repetition is broken to an extent by different tracks for the menu and pre-game instructions.  The player is tasked with purchasing chickens, collecting eggs, processing the eggs to make powder eggs, processing the powder eggs to make pasta and also accumulating funds. Storage facilities can be upgraded as can manufacturing facilities. Cats and dogs can be hired to help capture ferrets and bears which can be sold at the market. As storage becomes full goods need to be transported to the market for sale.  The style of play is arcade action with puzzle solving and resource management aspects. There are rewards for completing level completion criteria within certain time constraints.  The game is fun to play and it can be quite challenging completing stages within the required time.  The game size is small which should be a relief to those with limited storage capacity on their compter or laptop.  To summarise, a fun family friendly game with really cute graphics and good re-play value for those who like casual games.  7.8 / 10",x,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0
Five Nights at Freddy's,"Amazing game! To those who like horror and havent played FNAF, bring a extra set of pants! The game mechanics are unique for all of the different games, and its worth the $5. Even when you have beat the game, there are countless easter eggs to find, and jumpscares to see. Overall, worth the money, will scare your socks of, and will thrill for weeks. To those stuck on 20/20/20/20 mode, no its not impossibe. Markiplier did it in 7 hours. :P",x,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Grim Dawn,This is by far the BEST ARPG game out there! I've had this game for 5days now and I can't stop playing it. In that time I think I've slept maybe 8hrs. Rest of the time im playing this HIGHLY addictive game. Grim Dawn is the game I wanted to play 30yrs ago. Thank you Devs for giving my gaming life meaning again! You are the best. I would give this game a 10/10 stars. :),x,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mathoria: It All Adds Up,"I'll play Devil's Advocate since it seems like only one other reviewer actually bothered to play this game all the way through.  Mathoria: It All Adds Up is a RPG-Maker game inspired by Pokemon with a combat system where the player must answer simple math questions in order to defeat opponents/obtain items.  The math aspect isn't particularly interesting (though it probably helps that my mental math skills are terrible), but anyone who rates this game negatively on the basis of 'it's teaching me math and too simple for me' likely isn't the intended demographic. This game is for parents who want to spend time together while teaching their kids. In that respect, this game does well. After playing through it, I'd say that if I had a kid I probably would do just that.   That being said, a few aspects of it didn't quite feel right for a children's game. The plot was much too deep for a children's story, especially the ending. Not only this, but I feel like a child 10 or under would have trouble with some of the words in the game as well (such as Vegabond). The story didn't even need to be as intricate as it was - most children beneath the age of 10 are usually willing to forego most plots in exchange for gameplay, so having a compelling story isn't too big a requirement.  There were also a few moments, such as someone saying '♥♥♥♥♥♥ off', that didn't sit well with me for a children's game. The rest of the game is good, innocent fun and there were actually a few sections I found myself genuinely enjoying, such as the minotaur puzzles and some of the villager interactions.  The controls are definitely clunky to begin with but you get used to them in time. As another reviewer mentioned, having to press Enter to enable the answer prompt and removing the question from the screen, as well as having a timer on the question itself (which the game claims makes you answer when it runs out, but in reality fails you if you don't), feels like a bad design choice. Especially when learning math on an easy difficulty, timing the player feels too difficult and forcing them to remember the question can easily be too complicated.   The game also focuses solely on addition and not any of the other modifiers like subtraction, division or multiplication, even on higher difficulties. I suppose it makes sense for younger children, but adding this as higher-level option would extend your demographic in a fitting enough way.  The delay between the answer box popping up and when you can type feels too short as well, causing me to mistype whenever I typed too fast, but somehow I don't see that being a problem for children who may type more slowly.   An options screen would be nice, however I find I didn't have much of a problem playing at a fixed resolution, and something tells me a child wouldn't mind it all that much either and possibly wouldn't even notice.  Visually the game uses a lot of RPG maker assets, which is fine since I feel like most children won't mind much unless they've played an RPG Maker game before. What looked like custom assets, however, stuck out like a sore thumb, such as a certain type of house and the ship at the end. Music felt very RPG maker-y and I hardly noticed it (which is a good thing) except for the credits/title music that felt far too hard rock.  As a game designer myself, here's my two cents: Dumb it down more. Even if you're targeting it towards parents and children, parents won't mind playing a more child-like game if their child is playing it with them. Your Pokemon references were enough to appeal to the older side of me, but most kids would be left behind by much of the game's design. This applies to controls as well - I know kids aren't stupid when it comes to controls, but an unintuitive interface could interfere with a child's enjoyment who might get bored easier than an adult. It's doubly bad if gamers are complaining about it!   All that being said, this is a student project targeted to children, so coming out of it those are my only notes. I got much more into it than I expected to, it just needs some tweaking to actually feel like a final product. At this stage I'd liken it to a prototype - one that's just about solid enough to play with a child.",x,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
MechWarrior Online,"There are Mechwarrior fans, and there are Battletech fans. If you are looking for a game that that is like Mechwarrior 4... this game is not that. You probably won't even like it.   If you are fundamentally incapable of playing on an impromptu team... you will not like it.   If you are not capable of ever adjusting tactics to new situations and the strengths/weaknesses of other random players... you will not like it.   If you think of yourself as being an invincible Rambo who should, through your own sheer awesomeness and force of will, be able to carry a team single-handlely, or at least get a rush of endorphins at how super-duper-awesome you are (i.e. you throw a tantrum every time you are humbled)... you will absolutely hate this game.   This game is not CounterStrike. This game is not Call of duty. This game is not a hum-dee-dum casual game like World of [Whatever].   This game is difficult. You will lose. A lot. You will play against people much better than you while on a team much worse than you. And that's tough, but life isn't fair. You want grittiness? That's it. You want challenge? That's it. You will grind. You must grind. And you will get batter for it. You will be frustrated sometimes. Good. That makes the next victory all the sweeter.   And for all of those things I listed above, this game is totally awesome.   There are plenty of whining people who give this game negative reviews. I strongly suggest you read them and evaluate if that sounds like the kind of stuff you would complain about. But if you see negative reviews about the 'poisonous' community, consider that the reviewer is probably the griefer who hogs up the battle comms with that stuff during a match and how obnoxious that is. If you see a review complaining about the mere existence of 'support' mechs... consider how that person must react to being on a team. If you see reviews that say 'X weapon is the best and Y weapon is the worst', and especially when you see that from different people about literally every combination of weapons in the game, consider how knowledgable these people must actually be about the system they are complaining about.   And ignore them all.   Try the game. If you don't like it; well, it was free and you can come back here to complain.   But, on the other hand... you might just find it to be the best damned real-time approach to BattleTech that has ever been realized.",x,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0
METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"As a long time Metal Gear fan this game story wise is a let down, A huge let down! IDK what they were thinking, but it must have been mass appeal. Shave down the story, throw MGS in a open world, have side kicks. Watch the casual gamers flood in.  The over all game play is good, but it has tons of bugs, if you knockout a guy in the guard post and pick him up, if you need to put him down before you are seen forget it.  Sometimes while crawling, there are just some rocks you can't crawl over...this will lead to begin spotted.  Honestly playing with stealth in mind Wont lead you to an S rank. If you run and gun, the time bonus will always lead you to an S rank.  The cut scenes are so short they are almost pointless.  Snake/big boss, now is almost a MUTE! kiefer sutherland must have cost an arm and a leg to the point of where they could only afford for him to cut a few lines. It's not that he's bad, its just snake has nothing to say! Something major could happen snake makes some faces. Someone important was hurt and he just says 'Move.'   Missions become repetitive, the fun I guess is finding different ways to do something. But that only go's so far, so many times. I should know I've played for over 84 hours   Missions checkpoints feel like a crap shoot. You stealth some major stuff. Than one glitch mistake and your mission is fubar! if you die sometimes the checkpoint kicks in, sometimes you die and you have to start the whole mission over again. may as well beat the game unlock everything you can than play again to try and complete all the side stuff for each mission, Otherwise you'll be pulling your hair out.  FOB, some people like it, most HATE IT!! I play offline so I never made an FOB, some people weren't so lucky, and now have to deal with enemy players stealing from them all the time.  It's like a bad version of dark souls world invasion.   Cheating in FOB is out of control with no fix in sight.   I haven't beaten the game yet, but with the way the story is unfolding, I'm losing interest by the 'episode' !0 out of 10. No, maybe a 7 out of 10.  all the major reviewers who gave this a great review went to one of those review camps where you only get so many hours with the game while Konami watches you.  the first 10 hours or so of MGS5 I thought it was the game of the year. 84 hours in and I have changed my tune.",x,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"I've played every game in the Metal Gear Solid series from the beginning, and I frankly think this game is a huge disappointment considering the hype and what it could have been. I'll break the Pros and Cons down:  Pros:    Graphics are pretty good    Voice acting is good    The open world dynamics make the game interesting    Environment is much more destructible than previous games    Gameplay mechanics concept is a sound upgrade from Peace Walker  Cons:    Terrible (almost game-breaking) object collision issues. Rocky terrain is your worst enemy because your character somehow can't even scale the smallest of boulders, which can get you killed in an intense situation.     Somehow they managed to make hugging walls and corners a lot worse. You'll encounter frustrating situations where you want to hug a wall/corner but can't, or just want to get to a specific place in a small room but end up hugging the wall instead.    Unsatisfactory plot. The game plays out in chapters like in Peace Walker but the storyline is very choppy and frankly I did not find the ending satisfying at all. It's as if the game's plot was incomplete due to rushed production. Leaves more questions than answers in the end. You don't even get to fight the person you hope you'd fight in the game.   Metal Gear Solid 4's and Peace Walker's strength was in their great ability to tell a story, not to mention smooth gameplay. Unfortunately, Kojima managed to make the plot so convoluted that certain story elements may conflict with those in the earlier games.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Metro: Last Light Redux,"I enjoyed it but my biggest gripe with this game and a lot of games today is the morality system. Metro Last Light probably has the single worst morality system I have ever seen in +1k hours of gaming. What is the point of designing and implementing so many various post-apocalyptic style guns and improvised weapons if the game penalizes you for using them? Now granted, you can throw caution to the wind and kill every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you come across with your bloodlust and accept the 'Bad/Evil ending' as your penance for the brutal, anarchaic, warmongering, murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you are...  But that ending is ♥♥♥♥.  A breath taking and death defying adventure with danger at every corner coupled with the anxiety over your dwindling supplies as you trudge through the darkest of Moscow's subway system brutally cut off at the end. And there is absolutely no forgiveness. It's completely all or nothing. Yes, you can spend 11 hours tediously sneaking up behind every guard, spare everyone's life, give every bit of your money to the poor, kiss babies, and volunteer at the soup kitchen every wednesday of the month, But then you get that one lapdance. Suddenly, you're the antichrist himself.   Okay, I exaggerate. Still there's no indication how far to one side you're leaning. You maybe be shooting for the good ending, and suddenly get surprised with the bad ending. The decision ultimately feels arbitrary, and it comes off like the game only wants you to play it a certain way. No, I don't want that in my games. The morality system soured the whole experience. An ending is supposed to leave you wanting more, but this has left me wanting to go play something else.  I give it a 5/10. However, if I played through the game and Alt F4'd out of the final scene to go watch the ending I want on youtube, I would give it an 8/10. Or better yet do away with the morality system altogether and I would give it an 8/10. This game could have been massively improved with one awesome ending as the grand finale.  The game was gorgeous and a lot of love was put into the story, but it's merits were over shaddowed by the morality system.   TL;DR watch the ending on youtube.",x,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,3

Nation Red,"Fast-paced top-down zombie survival game with some vague RPG elements (you can upgrade yourself from time to time as you level-up, and choose from 4 classes to play as). My only issue is that your levels reset as you move through stages, and it can be difficult to remember what you may have purchased in the current stage.  Nation Red seems to be made primarily as a multiplayer shooter, and it does fine as a non-FPS. Single player is still fun for a while at least, and there are multiple modes to choose from, but it's just shooting waves of zombies - that can get a little boring after some time. Definitely worth my $2.50 but online multiplayer is pretty sparse... I guess not many people picked this game up? Play with your friends when you can.

Neverending Nightmares,"I played the whole game on one playthrough, I couldn't stop playing. After I had the first ending, I kept wanting more.

You feel like you enter the mind of someone, or something... the differents path... everything seems alike but is quite different and it seems like an endless maze. After the secon ending, I started feeling bad about the game. I even felt sad and desoriented, I had goosebumps, enven though if there aren't jumpscares.

Neverending Nightmares," “Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams.” ― Bram Stoker,  Dracula    I've been wanting to play this game for a long while, and I've finally managed to do so, the other day. For a month, I found myself quitting each and every time when I sit before this game, even with the perfect resolve to complete it. Yesterday, I did it. In the end, it left me with mixed feelings. I certainly appreciated the art and the thought process, yet did I love the game? I think 'love' is a big word to define this particular psychosis.  The game is a survival horror adventure + walking simulation. Young Thomas is a man trapped within his own nightmares. He wakes up in an old Victorian mansion - presumably his parents' house - and starts to walk around, pacing within countless disturbing settings which supposedly represent his own subconscious. By the end of each nightmare, a new one starts, and he wakes into another nightmare, and another... and so this goes on and on. Every time that he wakes up, the nightmare seems to twist into a bit more disturbing and gory version of what he has already encountered. Themes of immense depression, guilt and decay are omnipresent. Thomas' only tie to the reality is a young woman, who seems to be his sister: Gabby or Gabriella... who constantly dies, for some reason. Symbolisms we gotta look beyond of? Hmph, I finished the game with all endings even, and I still don't know.  The opening of the game is pretty disturbing and catches your attention quickly. The artwork is hand drawn, an eerie pen &amp; ink style drawing that recalls Edward Gorey. I should state that an immense labor was put into even the art of the game. Everything is in black and white, drawn with countless dots and brush marks to work on furling shadows. Only blood and certain objects that you can interact with are presented in colors. Combined with background sounds like whispers, dragging noises, moans and whimpers; an astonishing atmosphere awaits you. Yet this atmosphere quickly loses its effect as the game continues.  The dynamics of the game are pretty basic. There is a tense, lonely period weaved with suspense and scattered flashes of bad omens which makes you tiptoe; and then comes the climax of either a bad memory or a gory enough scene. This equation loops each and every time, added up with the optional presence of a monster to avoid. After a while, added with the loss of direction due to 'neverending' display of the same environments with some new events, you start expecting what is to come and everything normalizes quickly. After the first half an hour, you get used to the dynamic and the thrill loses its effect over you. You start playing the game automated, just for the sake of finishing it in hopes of understanding the storyline.  Gameplay only gives you the option of walking in a direction, rarely pick an object and change rooms via doors. Oh, and you have the option of running for a little while with the shift keys, if you are to avoid a monster. If you keep a different elevation, you are able to avoid most monsters. For others, you only need to leave the room. I completed all endings with only 4 death counts, once for each kind of monster you have to deal with and I'm not particularly good with my reflexes either. If I managed, anyone can manage to avoid monsters, endure some gory scenes and finish all endings within 3 hours if they want. That kinda diminishes the thrill of the game and with this much repetition, it gets boring quickly.  We are informed that the designer of the game, Matt Gilgenbach dealt with severe depression and OCD which gave inspiration to creating this game. In my opinion, the artwork and the themes used may indicate depression, but the only indication of OCD that I've observed is the art style itself, consisting of countless hand drawn lines and dots. Whew! That is OCD if I've seen one! But the gameplay and the story has nothing to do with any of these mental conditions. So it would be hypocritical to exemplify this game to promote awareness for either depression or OCD. No, I'm not a psychologist, but I'm sufficiently trained in psychology and, I suffer from minor OCD. I also had a brief depression period 5 years back - as any individual with an above average IQ in modern society. Yet again, experience is always subjective so I cannot declare mine as the sole verdict on an artwork.  On my own experience, I cannot recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for symbolism and well-crafted atmospheres, and I certainly don't declare myself as capable to understand everything concerning human psyche, but there is no consistent story. Only details thrown around to make room for you to craft a meaningful story yourself. I've read an explanation in discussion forums, and thought 'this should be it' long after I finished the game. Aside its success on atmosphere, this game ends up being an excuse for gore. Combined with its flawed horror dynamic, I'd say the current price is real steep for what you're getting yourself into. Then again, art IS subjective.  Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page  here  - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",x,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3
No Man's Sky,"No Man's Sky isn't a 'bad' game, don't get me wrong. But here's the 3 main reasons I'm reviewing this as negative:  1) The game is highly repetitive. You will be doing the same things over and over again, meet an alien, pick one of two choices to hope the alien likes you; go to a planet, shoot your laser at a rock; use the resources to make things or buy things, go get more money by shooting rocks; look at creatures, realize creatures are starting to be the same as previous planets...  2) The price of this game is AAA pricing, $60. I think it's actual value is around $20 at launch. I would compare this game to Minecraft except in space, without building, without friends.. which takes away a lot of the value I find in a great game like Minecraft.  3) The overall goal is to reach the center of the galaxy/universe. I'm gonna say spoiler warning right now but honestly there is nothing to spoil. So *SPOILER WARNING* after all your hard work you return to the start of the game in a new galaxy. Whats new about it? Well.... the game says something other than 'Euclid Galaxy' now. That's it.  I said this game wasn't all bad, so the good things include Ship variety, flying around is fun, the initial hours were fun to go explore, some great visuals while in space, and overall I enjoyed the time I had in this game. Games involving repetition to achieve better gear and loot are something I enjoy.. But after a while it was easy to see that everything was the same; space battles, space stations, planets, etc. Everything is beyond repetitive.  It doesn't deserve it's current score (what's it at, 18% negative?!), but I cannot give it a positive review rating...  Score: 5/10",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nuclear Throne,"Nuclear Throne. A rogue-like twin stick shooter created by Vlambeer, a company with an excellent track record, no doubt about that. I saw this and bought it immediately: roguelikes, a bit of bullet hell, and a badass illuminati character all drew me in.  I was not dissapointed.  Characters--each with their own story, with their own abilities, with their own personal mutations that go with them. Weapons--too many to count; whenever i pick up a weapon I've never see before, it's like an new game to me. Enemies--each with bizzare weapons and attacks, and the bosses are intimidating and a thrill to play against. Music--amazing soundtrack, adds to the game's theme of 'A nuclear fallout with absurd creatures and guns everywhere' Secrets--do I really need to go into these? A plethora of secrets, and when you find them, well; I'll leave that to you.  However, I haven't tried co-op, and only have 10 hours on it, so I don't know everything about the game.   About half the negative reviews complain that the game is too hard and are only open for a small amount of gamers. I do acknowledge this fact, and warn you if you're buying it that there will be runs cut off by a bad spawn.  But you are getting more than your money's worth in terms of gameplay.

PlanetSide 2,"Wasn't expecting much from this game when I downloaded it seeing as it was on the third page of the 'Free To Play' section of Steam.  4 months later, I can't stop playing. Planetside 2 offers several things:  - A real F2P model. You can buy things with real money, but you need to earn the money in-game for several things. Upgrades to character suit and utility slots must be done wit the in-game currency for example. - Continent - scale battles. At prime time on the server I play on, you can reach over 1000 people playing on one server, duking it out for control over a continent.  - It's just as fun to play with friends in a squad as it is to play solo. Both come with different tactics to try and take on bases, but you'll find yourself playing in a squad most of the time.  - A challenge. There is no match-making in this game. You will often find yourself getting instagibbed by pro players. I view this as a positive because playing this game has a serious effect on the way you play FPSes.

SAGA,"ITS BAD.  SAGA was originally let loose on the world back in 2007 and while its visuals were decent for the time and the music was good the game eventually died in 2011. Rejuvinated and reborn 6 months ago and thrust here on steam no less, SAGA is back! I'm not going to lie, I was happy to see it return and my old account even still worked, how minted is that?  But the cynicism crept in slowly and thickly the more I played. The game crashes, a lot! You won't recieve any error message and if you are above and beyond the minimum specs as you no doubt was even when the game came out originially then its even more boggling how unoptimized it is that even a high end system can chugg along trying to run it. Feel free to turn all the graphical effects off though because they firstly look bad and secondly make the game  harder  because the foilage that the enviroment adds can cover up enemy units!

Enemy difficulty  leaps  up! after the tutorial prepare for a blast to the past as you spam chat with 'LFP' which wouldn't even be the worst offense if it wasn't for the fact; why spend money on the game to buy stronger units  at all  when the difference in power is not noticable?!  Speaking of not noticable, the game asks you to pick a starting faction. Pick any. Seriously, they all start out  exactly  the same, with human units, so why even have a choice? And its one of  those  games, you know the kind, 'Pick a starting race, you will be stuck with it and you cannot change your choice before you even know the pros and cons of your choice'  You picked undead? were expecting an undead army? Wrong son you get humans! Picked Orcs? So on and so forth.  Now these are all sprinkles on a turd. Most players can overlook these niggles and enjoy the game. What will be the breaking point however is army building. To get cards you need to enter tournament play...And win. You get nothing for taking part so winning is all that matters. Pay2win? No, you can't use your personal army that you have invested time and energy and maybe money into, what are you stupid?  No, you ent-- Crash. You attempt to e-- Crash. You look at the en-- Crash.  If you can even  make  it into tournament mode without crashing (the menu to enter can cause a crash!) then you are not out of the woods yet as you can still crash during the fight which is an auto lose. You get nothing for participating, you have to win, so crashing, which is no fault of your own, means you get  nothing .  Its not even about the fact you HAVE to buy the army of the faction you picked, in order to use it, but the mere fact that the army you buy, is worthless! You can't solo anything worth a damn with it so why even bother buying it? Unlike most successful pay2win games, buying units does nothing, you can't even use them for PvP, which PvP is buggy anyway!  Some things should remain buried. This is SAGAs second chance and they either need to release patches fast to step up the state of the game, or its just going to get buried amongst all the other 'mostly negative' games on Steam.

Saints Row: The Third,"Strongly recommended.  Saints Row is like a GTA but in funnier, crazier and a more arcade way. Steal tanks in midair, surf on car, get naked and run like crazy monkey in the streets, defend yourself with a purple huge dìldo, etc.  Compared to a classic GTA, Saints Row might look easier: your health regenerates (CoD like), you start with lotsa ammo and guns, once you grab a new gun it's added to your crib cache and you don't have to buy it again and so on. However the game itself is actually much more difficult. You will have to fight both gangs and cops. The city sometimes becomes a real war zone with SWAT team rushing into an interesction full speed with their armored truck, cops choppers firing on hostiles, you defending your crib that has been attacked by a gang, the laters bringing their homies with them. Being in middle of all this mess is eerie. You won't survive with another game mechanisms. So, grab your smartphone and call your crib, your favorites homies and increase the chaos in that intersection even more. Can't seem to protect your crib? Too many people running around and shooting everywhere? Okay, call for an airstrike. Missiles will rain down that poor intersection anihilating everything.  It's a lotta fun, really. You will always find something to do in that city. There are many side missions that get unlocked when progressing into the main story. Doing those mission will increase your influence aera and spawn homies in the street that you can call in case of emergency. Also, your hourly money benefits will increase the more area you got and the more businesses and houses you buy.  And best of all, you can play the whole game in coop with a friend. How awesome is that uh? HOW AWESOME IS THAT? While you drive, your homie is mowing down he street; while you take cover he throws nades on hostiles; while you run naked in them streets your bro is covering your tight äss with a molusk launcher. Yeah you heard me. A MOLUSK LAUNCHER THAT CAN MIND CONTROL PEOPLE!!  Now you oughta get it: Saints Row is uber fun and crazy. Even the cutscenes sometimes go like: 'Isn't there an easier way to get into that plane?' she asks. You just raise your brows and say 'Without a doubt honey.'.   There are many more features this game provides, so many I just can't enumerate them here in this review. Now I'm trying to find the negative points of Saints Row... and can hardly find any. Uhhh yes, you cannot import your own music to play it within the game... well, that's it. :D  So what are you waiting for? Don't wanna waste zombies using a huge dìldo while being naked? Eheh, well... you don't know what you are missing. :)",x,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0

Shattered Skies,"After reading all the negative reviews I wouldn't agree with most of them. This game is beyond addicting and a lot of fun. You will enjoy this game a lot if you are a hardcore pvp player even if you solo. If you like hardcore pvp this is the game for you... you will die a lot but it gets better as it goes on. If you don't like hardcore pvp and are a casual player then do not buy the game. We all know its the devs from WarZ and ISS with their bad reputation, but this game is actually amazing and there are literally no cheaters running around because they all get banned. I have almost 200 hours from beta alone and I have never ran into a cheater. Their anti-cheat is on point so far and I hope it continues to be. There are two downsides to this game one is being that you will need to most likely buy gold edition or better because you will need the vault slots and it also gives you xp, but they just patched the requirements for levels of guns you can use and lowered it so you only need level 20 to run around with a legendary. The other downside is that you will die a lot regardles of what you do.. just keep playing and you will get better and stay alive a lot more. I 100% recommend this game to anyone that likes pvp. I really hope the devs keep up with how their working on the game now and if they do this game will succeed. They patch the game really often and fixed a lot of bugs and change a lot of different things by listening to the community. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who likes pvp games.. the pvp is amazing.",x,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,3,0
Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"TL;DR: Broken AI, Broken Diplomacy  My first negative review. Please do not judge my hours, I play my games off line as I 'work for travel!'  Do not get me wrong, you will have a ton of fun building and managing the empire. Unfortunatelly, there is no challenge when it comes to diplomacy.  I have played all Civs (from the original one) and witnessed a lots of progress when it comes to graphics, empire management and gameplay. The new release brings slightly different gameplay, but unfortunatelly the AI has not evolved.   I would love to see smarter AI, not cheating AI.   So, what is so bad about AI? Broken AI and diplomacy; some examples include: -AI settlers travel unprotected -AI settlers hesitate to build cities, just roam -AI DOW when much inferior -AI unrealistic peace negotiation offers when loosing -trading resources deals do not make any sense (sometimes you get great offer and 30 turns later bad offer for the same resource) -player penalty for broken promises (keep units away from border, building cities close to AI), when in fact the promise was kept -no penalty for AI broken promises -AI does not upgrade units -AI comments on my empire sound like riddles that I really do not understand or actually care about.  It almost feels like AI makes lots of random decisions. One moment they are impressed with my navy (I have only two ships) and then 20 turns later I am denounced for having a weak navy.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Spec Ops: The Line,"First off, BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME!, It's absolutley fantastic!  Secondly, here's why:    The story is simply too original to describe, People may overlook this game as a basic mil-spec shooter, but it is NOT! The main focus here is the EFFECTS of war on the soldiers not the shooting, although the mechanics work great and the gameplay feels solid too. The story follows 3 soldiers stranded in a dying Dubai, a Dubai they thought they were there to save. Surrounded by a raging sandstorm that is too strong to break through they fight their way through hostile sand covered streets and buildings to reach their goal of saving the civilians trapped there. Although nothing is what it seems.  The twists and turns the story takes almost put the writing of games like Bioshock and GTA to shame.   GamesRadar.com  reviewed the game in their 'The best videogame stories ever' article and I feel a direct quote would be sufficient:  'Military shooters don't often rank high on the narrative front, usually favoring gung-ho G.I. Joe antics and flag waving over character development. And, at first, Spec Ops: The Line falls right in line with that stereotype--you take control of Walker, a soldier sent into a sandstorm-ruined Dubai to find a missing general. But as time goes on it becomes more and more obvious that there's something more devious afoot, and the shooter's story transforms from run-of-the-mill to one-of-a-kind.  What unfolds is a damning criticism of shooters themselves, questioning everything that gamers have grown accustom to. Walker's journey sends him marching into the nucleus of the genre, playing with the storytelling in ways no other game has. By the end you might feel anger or sadness, but the important thing is that you'll feel something, and that's pretty rare in military shooters.'  I truly feel anyone who can play a shooter, even poorly, NEEDS to experience this game!  Side note, I know it reads out I only have 2.5 hours, but most of the time spent playing through the SP was offline while my internet was disconnected lol.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0

Star Trek Online,"I love Trek, and I loved this game for a long time. I played this game OBSESSIVELY from launch until not too long ago (not all through Steam). The devs need to grow a pair and balance this game. If the bottom line is all that matters, and it's making money, then good luck to them, but it's no longer for me.  First time around, the stories are interesting and quite fun to play, and if you're into it, then some of the player created missions in-game a fun too, but that's all solo stuff, and the devs WILL find ways to make even the newest player play through ALL of them several times so that not even solo players can escape grinding.  When it comes to anything you do with other people, it's a ridiculously REPETITIVE, and intolerably EASY grind fest. Sure, you need to know a little about the mechanics, but however good or bad you are at the game, you only really need two of the five players to know what they're doing, and there there might as well only be one end game mission in the game with random enemy spawn, as all the maps are essentially the same.  With the addition of JJ stuff, and the rest of the frankly silly Agents of Yesterday expansion, I will never play this game ever again. GG Mr. Captain Lizard Man - You know who you are.  You'll either love it and turn into an uber fanboy/girl for whom the devs can do no wrong, or you'll play it for a month, max out your first character and go play something else.  Free to play? Yes, that I will give them. You pay to be impatient, not to win, and it is possible to get everything in the game (barring a few items that won't affect your competitiveness) without paying a cent. Be prepared to spend a long time grinding for it all though, or else start with a plan to have several characters in order to speed up the process.   I can't fault the F2P model, as it is one of the more player friendly models I've seen, but end game is so utterly boring once you've done everything even a few times (you'll end up running several maps more than just 'a few times') that it's simply not worth investing the time in as once you do max up, there's a real sense of 'OK, what now?', to which the Devs answer seems to be 'Buy this new OP ship and make the end game stuff even easier' or 'Make a new character so you can enjoy all our solo content ALL over again'. There little to no PvP, and like I said above, a team of monkeys and one half decent player can tackle most of the end game content.  And lastly, they talk in their trailers a lot about Exploration. It's total BS and there is literally nothing like that in the game. Let me repeat that. In a STAR TREK GAME, there is NO EXPLORATION element AT ALL.  Meh.

Tactical Intervention,"I honestly think that if the devs were to retitle this game as 'Hollywood Car Chase Simulator 2014', this game would sell like hotcakes. Dead serious.  Anyway, let's get on to the actual review: Tactical Intervention is an FPS that is quite ironically the least tactical game you will ever play. But does that make it bad? Of course not. Tactical Intervention has quite a few charm points, which I genuinely think you should try out at least once.  THE GOOD:  As stated in the title, Tactical Intervention features a car chase game mode, in which the Terrorist team is given 1-3 cars to chase after a Counter-Terrorist VIP, who is also in a car. The mode is hilariously glitchy, but in an incredibly fun way, as referenced by STAR_ in his 'Tactical Intervention 1.6' video. Another thing I genuinely appreciate from the dev team is their attention towards the playerbase. A lot of people (myself included) complained about the recoil system in that it was too spazzy (your screen would literally shake up and down frantically as you fired). Within a month, they fixed the recoil system, so shoutout to FIX Korea for their totally bro devs! The guns in this game are something which I feel more game devs should take note of. All of the guns are very well balanced (with 1 or 2 outliers, but you can't be perfect), and each have a role- Sniper/Marksman Rifles are for Long Range, Assault Rifles are for Mid Range, SMGs are for Close Range, and Shotguns are for Point Blank. The guns have a customization system, allow you to purchase silencers, optics, compensators, flashlights, and weapon camos. Oh, and did I mention that this game does a great job of the whole F2P thing? The in game economy is similar to TF2, in that the only cash-only items in the game are character models and weapon skins.  THE BAD:  You probably only heard of Tactical Intervention because you clicked on the 'Free-To-Play' section in the Steam Store. Well, that's another problem with TI. The playerbase is very, very, very small. The number of concurrent players is literally smaller than the entire population of Vatican City. Go ahead and take a moment to Google that if you wish. It's not uncommon to meet the exact same people day after day, and that means that if you happen to come upon a toxic player, guess what? You're probably gonna see them again before the day's over. I did say that most of the weapons in TI are well balanced, but there are some outliers. And quite frankly, those outliers are really damn powerful. The AS50, a semi-automatic .50 caliber anti-material rifle, has the ability to kill a player in one shot- yes, you read that correctly- to ANY part of the body (unless you buy armor, but most people don't know about the existence of armor). Sure, it has a ton of scope sway to compensate, but you can noscope with it very easily, making it a threat in CQC. Another unbalanced weapon is the M4 STAR 10, known commonly as the M4 Super 90. The Super 90 is a 12 guage, semi-automatic shotgun with a very high rate of fire, and an uncomfortably long range. Its running accuracy is damn high, too, meaning that you can literally bumrush a group of people face first, and probably kill them. All of them. What makes it worse is that all the guns in the game can be bought with IGC (in game currency), so your average noob can buy a Super 90 literally the moment he boots up the game (all players start with $50000, just enough to buy a Super 90)  THE UGLY:  As mentioned in the Bad section, the playerbase is very small. And I really don't mean to make fun of anyone by saying this, but 90% of players literally have no clue what they're doing. Like, if you go into an S&amp;D server, you'll see people shooting at the bomb. Even if you tell them to hold down F. Which is another problem with the game- since its F2P, the vast majority of players are from BRIC (Brazil/India/Russia/China), or some equally foreign country like Poland or Peru. I don't know if it's out of ignorance or hatred or both, but pretty much no one speaks English, and some people will even go as far as to make fun of you for doing so. Which is ironic, since everyone plays on the AMERICAN servers. Speaking of servers, why do the non-americans play on American servers, and then complain about all the lag?!?! Like, go into your average lobby, and I guarantee at least 80% of the pings will be above 100.  CONCLUSION:  Don't take the game too seriously (or seriously at all, for that matter), and you'll be just fine. TI is a nice game to blow off some steam, but just like Quake, it's a minimalistic game, meaning there's no unlockables or anything like that, so don't be surprised if you quickly decide that you're bored of the game.  6/10",x,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,3,0
Tales from the Borderlands,"  I came into this game expecting it to be like Sam and Max, Monkey Island, etc. A strong puzzle/adventure title with a lot of humour and messing around. And what I got was...something else.  Don't approach this expecting to challange your mind, shoot up some badies, get phat loot and enjoy a bit of story. Approach this like a 12-14 hour box set of a TV show. The interaction is fairly limited, but enough to keep you engaged. You have Quick Time Events, where if you fail them something else (generally not benifical) will generally happen but you don't always die. You have point and click elements where you control a person trying to shoot something quickly. You have dialogue choices, lots and lots of them. And you've got small sections where you have I guess a puzzle? It comes more down to slowly navigating the world, clicking on stuff and amusing yourself with the dialogue.  The story is great. Really really great. It has pathos, it has humour, it has great set pieces and intresting looks at characters. A lot of characters from Borderlands One, Two, The Pre-Sequal and other Borderlands media appear, and it is intresting seeing them from another angle. People caught up in their mayhem or dealing with the after effects of the Vaults.   Also, I don't think I can go any further without mentioning the music. Each episode starts with a playable cutscene that turns into the title. Each one has fantastic music and is one of the best bits of each game. And because it is a bit of a struggle to find on youtube due to copyright claims, the song in Episode Five is Retrograde by James Blake.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Oh wow, I forgot I never wrote a review for this game.  Initially I'd say I like this game a lot, and in all honesty it has more of what you would enjoy from the first binding of Isaac, but there are some issues that just really seem to kill it for me.    One of the issues is the new soundtrack which just feels flat compared to the original. In the original soundtrack, it gave you an atmosphere that really made you feel more involved in the game despite it being about a naked baby shooting tears at poop all day. In the new soundtrack, it's just simple music which works for any rogue like, but isn't something all too interesting or memorable for that matter. I found myself later turning the music off when playing the lost mode.   My other issue with the game is enemy variety. Though the variety is pretty colorful, you'll find yourself getting bored to tears in the basement dealing with the million fly and spider variants which feels like a cheap way to add variety. Oh and if you are playing the lost mode, it will drive you nuts to know your progress was cut short just cause you overlooked the black fly that blended into a crack in the ground.   My third issue that kinda hurts the model of this game for me is the large rooms that were added in rebirth. I like the idea of experimenting with new layouts and such, but when the large room isn't a puzzle room, it's usually just bloated with enemies. Most of those enemies being flies, so you spend an unnecessary amount of time taking out easy enemies which just tests your patients more than your skill. This is even worse in the lost mode, or when you are trying to do a time attack.   My final issue though is the attempts the developers took enforce balance especially for hard mode. Typically in a game, you don't want broken features that make your game too easy, but in a rogue like, I think that is a valid exception since luck is such a necessary factor for any of those things to happen. Unfortunately rebirth won't hesitate to escalate difficulty dramatically whenever you get a powerful weapon especially if it's early in the game as a means to balance the difficulty. Strangest part though, is the fact that really difficult bosses like the haunt, and Dingle will still be featured in the basement. Overall, I just feel the balance is a double standard where you will be penalized for improving too fast while the game can still have a hay day throwing wild cards at you without any penalty. I never ran into an issue like this in the original binding of Isaac and it held up as a fun and memorable challenge so I'm disappointed that this game doesn't feature the same experience.  Overall, I'd say it's still a good buy if it's on sale, but I'd just suggest playing the original.",x,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0
The Blackwell Legacy,"tl;dr: If you're a fan of the old LucasArts games circa 1990, this is for you.  This is the first in a surprisingly polished series of retro adventure games that capture the spirit (no pun intended) of the old Ron Gilbert-Tim Shafer LucasArts adventure games. They aren't quite as witty as those, but the puzzles are good and the gameplay is fun. This isn't the best game of the series, but it should be played first, because it sets up the premise that carries over into all the games that follow. In fact, the entire series is best played in order because there are references in later games to the events of this and Blackwell Unbound, the second game. The lead characters, a reluctant young medium and her ghostly spirit guide, give the game much of its charm, and the voice acting is on a professional level. (Be sure to watch the end credits to see the people you've spent the game listening to.)  If you've been itching for a game in the classic style, this game and the ones that follow will scratch that itch. I've played up through game four and the experience has been rewarding. I've bought game four without waiting for the price to drop and I plan to start playing it tonight. Apparently it's the grand finale that will reveal those parts of the backstory that we don't get in the first four games. I can't wait. (And the 33.6 hours that Steam claims I spent playing were mostly from those times I was working in a different window while the game waited for me to come back.) There are occasional crashes but the game autosaves, so you don't lose much.  9/10 - Well worth playing if you're into this sort of game. If you're more into action games, stay away (not that I don't enjoy those too).",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Ship,"After finding this game on sale through Steam for four bucks, the decision to pick it up (along with two free gift copies) was a no-brainer. It’s a bit like “Clue” in that the mysterious Mr. X has invited a bunch of people to embark on a cruise…but things get ugly when you learn that cash is rewarded to people who manage to murder their targets. Guards and cameras exist to keep people from going homicidal, as well as a full-fledged jail for anyone caught breaking the rules. On top of being sneaky, you’ll have needs to meet like in “The Sims”…thirst, social, that kind of thing.   The game does support AI…in fact the game comes with three different game modes: Tutorial, Single Player, and Multiplayer. It’s best to try out the tutorial first, followed by the single player. Once you manage to get past those, you’ll find that there are a few in-game modes available: Hunt and Elimination. Hunt uses a timer to mark the length of rounds while rounds in elimination ends with the last person standing.

The Talos Principle,"In general, Talos Principle is a very-very good puzzle game, which is a little more difficult than usual.  On the other hand, this is not what happens with the extra challenges, which are... extremely difficult...!!!  If you buy this game and try to complete 100% of it, you will never succeed this without the help of YouTube (thank God, there are good walkthrough videos there) unless you are one of the developers or the reincarnation of Albert Eienstein. So, if you buy this game, you should try to solve only, as many puzzles as you can and then, you will enjoy it as mush as i did (it happened, when i finally realised, that i am not the reincarnation of Albert Eienstein... too sad...)  Comparison with Portal If you try to compare Portal with Talos Principle, Portal wins by far, in my opinion, because its puzzles were more balanced, its support characters where more funny and finally, the plot was giving you a standard goal from the beginning of the game, making it more interesting than a continuous puzzle solving.  Verdict Is Talos Principle a Good Game then? Definitely yes.  If you liked Portal games, or if you want a puzzle game that will challenge you to your limits, you should give Talos Principle a try and maybe, you will love it as much as Portal....

Might sound bad to have a sad game but the happy moments you get along the way where everything is at peace ( or at least as much as it can be in a zombie apocalypse) really felt special and I will definatly be preording season 3 as I did season 2.   SPOILER ALERT.  Well the ending for this season has from what I know somewhere around 5+ different endings. All ranging from different people you are with the way you got there or hell a different side of the country. In my natural state of Kenny is my home boy, I had sided with him since episode one screamed like a little girl when he came back and my God did this game try to make me want to kill him the last two episodes. In the end Kenny is derailed as a man who loses so much is, and has a beacon of hope which is this child, now when an equally great character comes along talks trash about his family, his mental state, and then to prove a point makes him believe she killed the baby without any reason other than ......, I understood why he might of started beating on her, now he got his fair share back , the only problem I had with this scene, not to sound like I wanted to beat a women but the options are all to hit Kenny or trip Kenny, or to shoot Kenny, none for Jane, but in the end Kenny gets the upperhand after having his stomach cut open and is ready to plunge the knife into Jane, playing as Clem you have the choice to shoot Kenny or to look away, after comtemplating it in what little time it gives you I sided with Kenny so Jne died, Kenny reasons with me about how he will never hurt me and I believed him, we later find the baby and he realises his rage was misplaced as she tricked him, anyway before the finding of the child and after the death of Jane you have the choice to shoot Kenny while he is down, now I just hope ( doubt it ) but hope they give the same choice for Jane because my God it was just hurt him, go on do it, beat on Kenny, which I wasn't going to do. Anyway the final choice for this season was to enter Wellington the fabeled land which is pretty great, with the baby and abonded Kenny, which he advocates for or leave with him. After a couple minutes of a teary speech between Clem, Kenny and me in tears ( totally not a wuss haha ) I had to leave Wellington, the safest place in the zombie apocalypse in my mind is with friends which Kenny proved to be with Lee and Clem on multiple occasions, so I ended this season again in tears walking away with Kenny and a baby. I would give this game the arbitrary rating of 10/10. As a series after this I have to say I prefer it to fallout, as a game fallout is still a better standalone, just haha. Might I also add this series has the worst death I have ever seen, and by that I mean bottom of the list as far as wanting to die a certain way, much rather get torn apart by zombies than what happened to my bro ;(",x,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3
The Witcher Adventure Game,"Essentially, this is a board game RPG based on The Witcher series of games, utilizing cards and dice to determine outcomes. The implementation is fairly simple to understand, particularly since you can play a game without any opponents. This allows one to get a feel for the game goals, mechanics, and character abilities. Overall, it is a fairly simple game, but for the price, is a unique game implementation.  Playing against the AI tends to get old quickly, but this is a great game to play with one's children if one is an older gamer with children such as myself. The rules are relatively easy to understand, and the implementation of cards can be a useful tool to help children with their reading abilities. The game encourages them to think ahead, and consider the probable outcomes. Playing alone gets old, but given the price and nature of the game, I highly recommend it as a 'family game' to play with the kids.",x,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0
They Breathe,"What's the most impressive about They Breathe is the way they managed to make it feel. The horror of the game isn't like that of a 3D horror, where the sound and visual deception plays a huge role. In this wonderful and nervetwisting game, you feel the horror through the gameplay itself. You play as a small frog, who dives into the depths of what seems to be a submerged forest, and as you progress down into the darkness, you'll progressivly start feeling both horrifed, utterly helpless and you'll struggle to maintain your cool as you swim to uncover what is really going on. It's a short game, and it's an outstanding game you'll get for only 2 euros. It's worth every minute of it.",x,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tomb Raider,"I've got faith in you... you're a Croft, after all.' Tomb Raider 2013 can be seen as a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. Yes, it is connected to the earlier games in so far as it is a prequel, or an origin-story so to speak - BUT, the Lara Croft we get to know in this one does differ from the slightly insane adult Lara with a serious disregard for endangered species. This Lara is so far just a young archeologist in pursuit of a legend surrounding an ancient Japanese city far out on the ocean. She and her group of politically correct friends set out on a journey to find said place and, of course, end up in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when a storm hit their boat and they're scrambled round the island trying to survive. Now of course this also does not prove to be an easy task with a bunch of cultists on the island with little regard to anyone else's lives.  While you do get Lara to constantly doubt herself when everyone keeps telling her 'You can do it!', she is not exactly alien to the concept of climbing up really high and dangerous places or, in fact, shooting people in the face with guns, arrows or even chopping them up with an axe. The only thing that seemed out of place to me was this whole 'Lara's still innocent and only does this sh*t to survive'-business this game keeps trying to sell. If you can look past that though and just accept that Lara is a little bit more of a badass than she wants us to believe she is then Tomb Raider 2013 still makes for a pretty good game. The running and climbing is smooth enough and the gunfights are fun, though it hurts that many of them are just setpieces set to take place when you reach a certain spot. They are still entertaining, though, and often allow you to make use ot the environment somehow. Stealth can also be used in some parts of the game, it is just a shame that the mentioned setpiece battles cannot be solved through that. Another shame is the frequency of things being introduced to you and then forgotten forever. The game starts out pretty realistically, with Lara struggling to find some food and shelter, but after her first deer she never seems to go hungry again, so the hunting-aspect is as obsolete as it is in Assassin's Creed III. You can still hunt for XP to spend on some abilities, as well as find scrap-boxes to improve your weapons with, but you get plenty and more from just playing the game as it is, from dead enemies and such.  Apart from these few flaws, the game is still worth playing. The landscapes are absolutely gorgeous and the characters (maybe apart from Lara herself) are pretty well characterised and believable. Stunning visuals and a fair deal of optional exploring (you actually get to Raid some Tombs in this game, figure that) is what you will get with Tomb Raider. I should mention that I played this with an XBox controller for best experience.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Total War: ATTILA,"UPDATED REVIEW FROM TOTAL WAR FAN PLAYED EVERY TOTAL WAR 4k hours in totalwar   Anything less then legendary is easy way to ♥♥♥♥♥ easy… but legendary Is just stupid this time around. Cons -No workshop until their done milking. -few factions- (expect 60+ $ atleast in dlc for just ♥♥♥♥ copy paste factions.. 2 dlc in the first week of release lol) -Limmited Diversity- hardly anything to recruit in factions (some seem like copies iv seen way better workshop factions from rome 2). -Battle Ai Builds seige but doesnt know how to use it. -CAMPAIGN AI- is the worst and super annoying (they will raid and run over and over maybe 1 out of 15 attackers will actually capture factions hardly change on the map except for rising rebels and razed settlements. Raiding will destroy your economy even if it is a pointless settlement it will criple ur game) -Reblions- public approval is the worst its ever been killing rebelions will do nothing for approval, and they will rise next turn again. making it impossible to leave ur base. -Turns are long ai hardly expands. -Should be called total war: horse archer horde Because thats all they build. This kills open feild battles even when u have horses they will kite the ♥♥♥ out of your army.  Pros -Ui is much better and makes it hard to go back to other total wars because it is done so well.(very good family tree) -Razing is fun and does change the map/gameplay. -Migrations are fun running razing and camping bring fresh breath into totalwar. -Faction leaders with way better skill trees and custom skins  -battle and campaign map LOAD MUCH FASTER.(tunrs are still long as ♥♥♥♥)  I have played every total war since i was a child(i have bought/played every single one with full dlc) my favorite being shogun 2/ and medival first one, and empires was also great.  TEAMS AND ROSTERS 3/5   There are very few teams (for the money) even with the vikinings The majority of the teams are copies of eachother and differ by maybe 1 or 2 units. example The viking forefathers have about 2 different units then the barbarian raiders and thats just in name.  rome/sansannids/huns have the biggest unit rosters, but they are not at all impressive. Want to be Britains tribes? Like in rome 2 where they had a ♥♥♥♥ ton of units? Ya you can’t be them, and all their units are roman units… they forgot to copy and paste the code im sure it will be a (7.99)dlc  AI CAMPAIGN 3/5   Nothing new here. Rasing settlements is the only thing that seems to be somewhat satisfying and its because of the AI.The ai is more annoying then ever. They never once took a city after 5 hours(only rebelions would AND your cities will rebel more then any previous total war before it. During the game the AI will spam units faster then you ever could (this is on hard to legendary difficulty) and the ai will declare war on you for litterly no reason (some times 4 of them at a time but this is also like almost all the total wars on hard to legendary difficulty).  Here is the new, the AI will spend the entire time just raiding your bases and then running away and coming back. If you dont chase them down, they will repeat this over and over which can get very frustrating chasing them for 10-20 turns. So instead of chasing them you end up razing your own towns just to be rid of the annoyance of the annoying ai. Also now teams do not die when u take their provinces they run into a secluded area and mass a horde until u kill them THIS IS ALSO VERY ANNOYING the rebelions will do this to they will sit out side your base and mass and mass and when u go to kill them they will runaway always being just out of reach.   AI BATTLE 3/5  The ai is SLIGHTLY and if not at all better during battles they do BUILD seige equiptment (atlast!) but are incappable of using it example: AFTER 11 turns of me being seiged they finally attacked out numbering me 4-1 mind u and still took 11 turns to attack.(i was, of course, excited to defend against such a force) My gates at the start of the battle were already broken for reasons unknown(probably an agent) yet they used ladders to get on the walls and the rest of their seige equipment stood still, they then abandoned the equipment and slammed as many forces through the gate as possible(this is after the gate was already broken, and they felt the need to take 10 minutes to get the ladders up) During non seige battles its the same except they use much more horse range lots of catapults.  UI  3/5  The ui has been changed and is much better then rome 2. The unit pictures are 3d representations of the units. They do have alot more notifications the hud is full of everything you will ever need to know which is great also the family tree is wonderfull.  Fraction leaders  4/5  The leaders are great they have 3 item slots( u dont pick up items they just randomly happen, and they do not change the look of you leader). Finally the skills arent just absolutely terrible like in rome 2. Great little skill tree. With that said it doesnt, even compare with shogun 2 hero trees.   Polotics  3/5  With the new ui political monitoring is easier and more neat. Just like in rome 2 you will have random events example: there is an earthquake should speal blood? Sacrifice a bull? Or ask a priestess? just like in the first one even if u choose right the affect is minor. And you will get annoyed of the spam of people trying to marrior your daughter and if you deny them they take away 20 gratitas(in rome it was adoption and took money to stop thank god that is somewhat over with happens very rarely now) and if u let them u get closer to civil war. It is exactly like rome 2 kind of meaningless. Diplomacy is the same to nothing new depending on the difficulty level of the campaign diplomacy will either be way to easy or impossible. On legendary as soon as one fraction declares war they all do again this is the same as most total wars.  Final thoughts  3/5  This expansion is not worth 45$ unless u truely love total war Hence why i bought it. If you are looking for some great fractions and new content u will be somewhat dissapointed. This game feels forced like they ran out of ideas and instead of making something new they decided to mod rome 2 and pretend it was a new game with fancy UI changes. Die heart fans will get a bittersweet taste.(bitter because of the half ♥♥♥ job done and sweet because of the for love total war.) For those of you looking for game changers, this is not one despite the new optition to horde which is ok but does not have a lasting quality about it.This is my first total war i give thumbs down. If you were trying to decide on wether to buy this right now i would wait tell its on sell would be a decent game at 29.99 and i bet you there will be over 100$ of dlc do to the lack of content. Rome total war 2 imperitus is better, and i would stick to that for now. If you didnt like rome 2, u will not like this. You also dont get the great feeling playing any of the fractions yes being atila is fun but fighting the dieing roman empire just isnt as glorious as when i played rome 2 when it got the imperitus update and you could play as Julius and turn the republic into and empire. Just the thought of my being julius/or any of them and conquering titans like Crassus Sepius, and pompei had refreshed the game by itself. But being the nomadic huns gives and fighting an empire thats split and been in decline for awhile gives no feelings of glory the team just isnt that well put together and rome is in decline (as you can tell by their roster) and is the worst team to play due to massive rebelions and nomadic tried running through ur base razing/raiding and running. U will neve have a big enough army to stop the raiding.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Total War: WARHAMMER,"I dont feel like any positive review have tackled anything the negative reviews are saying, one of the major ones being this is a simple game. These are by elitists, who need to get off their high horse and go play a paradox game, that is a place for elitists and ♥♥♥♥♥ing about DLC(Paradox does actually kick ♥♥♥, if youre into grand strategy games and charts and graphs simulation) but this is total war, made for any player to walk into, learn how to build building, so you can go murder your enemies in large battle. This game does that really well, its not dumbed down, they have made it easier for anyone to walk in and figure out how to build large armies and murder others, however for returning total war fans you will notice a lack of reskins between the major factions(looking at you shogun) and it feels really good to watch my chosen run into battle with Archeon and slaughter the weak followers of Sigmar as they rightfully should be. This brings me to my next point, the DLC, we had the time to get it free, then they even extended that time to help ease our minds, so really if youre paying for it then it is your fault, but the dlc is amazing, Chaos Undivided is one of the best factions ever put into a total war game, with the spread of corruption, the horde mechanics, and the once again unique playstyle they bring, its worth it, full unit roster, id say even more fleshed out than some of the other factions, a quite literal horde of units to choose from with them, makes them worth every penny for all you hold outs who are looking at the negative reviews. So not only did they release it the DLC for FREEE, its ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, and worth it if youre on the fence.   The game is not perfect, this is true, i really wish i could play as the Brettonian vampires and not have them be exact look alikes of the vampire counts. Oh wait, i can. The modding community is great, almost every problem you might have, they have fixed, I have a burning hatred for the stunties, they are the true enemies of the Warhammer World, and now as the Vampire counts, I can conquer their citys and lead a dark crusade into their lands because I've decided the humans aren't all that bad, they actually helped me fight off chaos, and with a mod released day 1, you can conquer every city. I'm barely scratching the surface here, please go take a look for yourself, there are some small issues i have and they are covered in other reviews, i just wanted to adress the negatives from elitists, games is awesome, please check it out and support it, tell CA we want more of this, this is hard work and dedication and it shows, we want more DLC that is great, and adds actual content, we want modder support, and we want a good Total War game.

Universal Combat CE,"I can totally understand the negative reviews - this is a hard game to like...in fact its a hard game period!  I had some crashing issues on first release on Steam but they seem to have been resolved now. The game itsself, looks pretty much like your typical space sim/shooter - but its much more than that.  Your are not some agile little FTL fighter - you are a battlecruiser / a capital ship / a mothership. If you scratch the surface you can micro manage just about everything onboard your ship...including sending agile little fighters out. I dont want to go into epic detail and make this review stupidly long, but suffice to say the learning curve is massive. I played this as a kid and i loved it! I still do - however i also loved hardcore Flight Simulators when i was a kid...and i think it is a similar kind of pleasure i get from this game.  Dont play this game because you want to shoot spaceships - play it because you want to spend a week learning to pilot a starship (and manage its crew!) ...then wage some war &gt;=)  Its free afterall! It'll only cost you time - but it will take you longer than a day before your playing like a Battlecruiser captain. FYI - You will probably have to go looking for your own fun too - there's a whole galaxy to explore, but no sign posts along the way ;)  Basically, IMO, Its a totally flawed masterpiece!",x,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,0
Viktor,"The TL;DR version: Mega Man had a cursed threeway on a full moon with Castlevania and Contra, and Viktor was the result.  Synopsis: 2D platformer/action shooter with great visuals, a kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack and better-than-expected mechanics, works beautifully with an XB360 or XBox One controller.  You shoot your way through selectable stages, each one being a different boss' realm. You can find new weapons, 2 of which can be equipped at a time along with your dual pistols, upgrade them between stages, as well as find certain passive power-ups like shields and active ones that add explosions to your shots, or provide unlimited ammo for a short while.  If you've ever wanted to basically play 2D version of Devil May Cry, this game is as close to one as you'll get.  Most negative reviews I've read have to do with performance and crash issues, none of which I've encountered during my playthrough, so I think it's safe to assume most of the major issues have been worked out.

Warface,"Before you say that I barely played this game then let me inform you that I played this game when it was in closed beta testing as a browser game about 10 months ago. I just downloaded it to try it now that its on steam to see if there are any big changes and here is what I found.  The game still has the same horrible cash shop as before and I really dislike cash shops like this where you can buy weapons and gear for real money, or you can buy them with ingame credits that takes a while to earn and the weapon only last for about 7 or 14 days (alot of guns are permanent though). The game does have decent balance between all the guns but I still don't like the cash shop system it has and you need to repair weapons.   I play a bunch of different games so I don't have the time to no life in this game for 7 or 14 days and grind. The best kevlar and helmet can only be bought for the co-op currency and only last 14 days. That system really sucks for me since if I buy something that last 14 days but I only play 7 days then I obviously lose on it. I am also not interested in the co-op part of the game.  The cash shop also seems to rotate a few weapons every 2 weeks that are only available for real money and only last 7 days.   The game has very small maps, granted some people might actually like that but I really hate these incredibly small maps where you can spawn and throw a grenade to the enemy spawn, it also just encourages a bunch of nade spamming and camping and spawn killing.  The dedicated / peer 2 peer / lobby server system is a good idea with potential but as it is right now after you play 1 map it takes forever for the next one to start on most servers because people always seem to leave and the host has to start each new match manually it seems but this could be cause the game is in beta. There are also always people that lag in every single match.  The games graphics are not that good on max settings. I know graphics are not everything but when they keep using it as a selling point and even on steam they keep bragging about 'cryteks cry engine' for example this is what it says under features of this game: 'Expect the best – Crytek's trademark quality meets free-to-play gaming' You kinda expect them to deliver but they really don't, this game looks like its from 2008.   So to sum it up: Game has bad cash shop, small maps with nade spam and campers and spawn killing, lobby server system with hosts that is buggy, laggy and slow. Graphics are not as good as they advertise them to be. Overall 'feel' and 'smoothness' of the game is really weird in my opinion and I just don't enjoy it that much. If you play this game then please look at the characters movements and stuff in the game and you'll see how sluggish, weird and awkward everything is.  Keep in mind this is just my opinion of the game, feel free to download the game since its f2p and try it for yourself, I am sure plenty of people will like this game.  Oh for all the people defending the game and saying its in beta, then yeah it is, but its been in beta for like 1 year now and the same problems exist now as they did back then, so to me that is no valid excuse. If you like the game and thats your opinion then good for you, but please stop defending the game by simply saying 'its in beta, what do you expect' bla bla bla.",x,0,0,0,1,0,3,3,0,0,0
Warface,"Horribly balanced an uninspired versus modes, if you're looking to make war on other people's faces, look elsewhere.  The Co-op however is very fun, with easily understood class mechanics and a decidedly old school feel. You might fail a mission a few times, but the game rewards learning encounters, and moves each mission up a difficulty level each day. The missions are cycled out at the top level of difficulty (hardcore) and a new mission enters the rotation at the bottom level (regular)  As free to play models go, there's decent progression to be had, and unlike a lot of similar games you're not forced to rent guns on a timer, but rather your equipped permanent weapons take durability damage. As long as you're consistantly winning at least half of the mission on skilled or higher difficulty, you end up with enough cash to repair your equipped gear and make a profit you can use to buy better stuff.  The shooting mechanics are solid, the guns feel meaty and worthwhile, and the sidearms are accurate and damaging enough to lean on in a pinch (or, if you're a shotgun-toting medic like myself, rely on for long range encounters) There are hard limits for weapon types per class, but the weapons and attachments generally have enough variety that you'll find something that fits your preference in the broad categories of SMG, assault rifle/machine gun, sniper rifle, or shotgun. The attachment system seems a little restrictive, wherin certain weapons can only mount certain attachments from their class (for exampleone shotgun may be able to use all of the shotgun rail attachments, but another may only be able to use two) but the ability to swap out attachments mid-battle gives them a lot of play.  The AI enemies are occasionally hilariously stupid, but generally present a decent threat which scales with difficulty level, and the game is not afraid to just spam you with hordes of faces to war on. The boss battles, which generally come in the flavors of heavy suit guy, giant walking mech, or helicopter are designed well enough that they feel fresh when moved to different environments as missions cycle.  For players that want to go above and beyond, there are certain secondary targets in each mission that reward speedruns and flashy kills/killstreaks with a special currency called crowns at the end. Crowns will allow you to rent some extremely powerful and flashy gear for a limited time, or throw them at a random box that has a change of giving a random crown rental, or a permanent (balanced) gun that is very good. This crown system is where I find most of the replayability, constantly trying to form teams capable of hiting the highest speedrun target time or putting together all-knife runs to try and hit the kill score target or whatever.  There are certain glitches and exploits found in missions now and then, but they tend to be the exception rather than the norm, which was a concern I had when researching the game. It's quite solid aside from the occasional getting stuck or random guy figuring out how to glitch a mission and whining because everyone else isn't using the glitch.  All in all, if you're a fan of co-op shooters and don't mind a pretty bland visual experience of soldiers shooting other soldiers, you'll probably have a lot of fun with warface, and I heartily reccommend it.",x,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,2,3,0

Wasteland 2,"Know what your money is going to buy you:   -A character with 1 strength attribute can break down doors. (Attributes have no bearing on skills. This is for me the single biggest fail I've ever witnessed in RPG(ish) gaming history)  -Very repetitive despite their best efforts to install a nice story. Some of the characters are fun but ultimately you aren't playing this game to meet these people (if that's your cup of cake I suggest you stream funny videos on youtube, there are plenty more funny people there than in this game). When you are outside of those (rare) fun events, pretty much everything is the same, sure there are a variety of creatures to pummel but they are all similar; you point your gun and you shoot at them...   -The skills in this game were designed by someone who has no skill in gaming; It seems to me that they wanted to advertise 'X' number of skills (haven't counted them) during their marketting campaign so instead of making interesting skills they give you: The Toaster skill, this skill does absolutely nothing but repair toasters and to your surprise there always seem to be items on said toasters.. Ofcourse you also have lockpick which opens chest which has items in them, computer skill which opens chests which have items in them, the safe cracking skill which.... you guessed it, opens chests that have items in them... Oh and my favorite skill of all? The demolisions skill, cause you know, EVERY trap in the game has an explosive tied to it...   -Character design (cosmetics) is as dull as you'd expect from a game designed in 2000.  +Weapons: A great deal of variety. Nothing bad to say here.  +/- (I think the - beats the + here but I'll let you dudge)World map: A fantastic concept, works great with one exception: Every 'Random' encounter is the same depending on the zone you are in. Seems to me that they created roughly 10 random encounters of 10 different levels and spread them out so you'd always fall on the same one depending on what level they figured you'd be by the time you got there. In order words; Exploring is out of the question, you'll get owned unless you follow the story.   I was a fan of this game from Wastelands 1 and refused to Beta test this game before release because I often find myself ruining the experience by playing an unfinished game. Well this game is finished, didn't crash once, it's just so poorly made (from an Tactical RPG perspective) that I feel robbed. Buy this game at your own risk but I'd be surprised if anyone puts in more than 20 hours before quiting.",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0
Weather Lord: The Successor's Path,"Weather Lord: The Successor's Path is a casual action puzzle game with a time attack element. Game play is very similar to Rescue Team 1 (by the same publisher 'BUKA Entertainment'). Your uncle has lost a sacred heirloom which has the ability to control the weather. You are required to assist with rescue and repair missions across the lands as you build houses, sawmills, lumber mills, foundries and other buildings. Along the way you will train or rescue workers to assist you. You will train brave knights to kill monsters and send workers to destroy monster lairs.   There are treasure chests which require keys, temples that need repair and mechanical devices that need to be repaired before rescuing innocent victims. Along the way to expanding your search in the kingdom you will meet a variety of beasts and challenges. You even have to bribe toads to allow you safe passage!  The art style is cartoon like and has a cute factor. The game plays perfectly at full HD 1080p resolutions.  The music is soft rock 'laid back' midi sequenced. Although repetitive sound loops are used the music is unobtrusive and pleasant easy listening. In game sounds are soft clinks and chinks and somewhat understated :)  Game play is fun and simple and gradually eases the player into more complex puzzle scenarios. Players can re-select any previously completed stage should they feel they could improve on their score or time performance. Completing all the objectives except one and ignoring the time restraint, the player can use workers to collect additional resources or just adopt a lazy sandbox approach but to get a good score players will need to beat the timer bar at the top right of the screen.  This game will appeal to young children and to adults who enjoy casual games. There is only low key cartoon fighting with no blood or gore, so the game is family friendly. This game and 'Rescue Team 1' as well as 'The Promised Land' would be great first additions to a young players game library.  Weather Lord: The Successor's Path will provide many hours of stress free casual gaming and leave the player feeling relaxed and happy. The game is extremely well thought out and almost bug free (unlike some disappointing AAA titles). The game did crash and lock up while attempting to take a screenshot as a level was completed, but progress had been saved automatically making it possible to resume play at next start up.  The biggest benefit of this game is the small file size (under 180Mb) which is small even compared to patches or updates of many games. So if you are one of the laptop casual gamers pressed for space this is the game for you!  This game is less complex and less demanding than 'The Promised Land' but is fun to play.  Weather Lord: The Successor's Path automatically tracks progress of each player name registered and so there is no need for a Game Save feature. This is a great benefit as a player can easily resume from where they were the next time they open the game without having to remember to save.  Weather Lord: The Successor's Path is a great casual time-waster and at the price is good value for money (especially if it is on discount). A fun game especially for the younger gamer age 4 to 10 but parents will need to accompany the child if the child's reading skill is not up to scratch yet.  6.2 / 10",x,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0
XCOM 2,"TL;DR: It's great As the second part of the reboot series of the Original UFO: Enemy Unknown, XCOM 2 is still quite unlike any other game you'd see nowadays. It is a mixture of both a political/economical strategy game and turn based small units tactical combat. The sole fact that it features turn based combat already makes it stand out from most modern game-titles. The game puts you in charge of a resistance movement that fights an alien government that has completely overtaken Earth after your (apparant) defeat in the previous title. As such you are tasked with contacting local resistance cells across the globe and uniting them. Additionally, you need to find out what the aliens are doing and how you can stop their plans on the 'Avatar Project' which is essentially a timer for your campaign, forcing you to take actions. This might sound bad for people who like to take their time and not worry about completion so much, but the game gives you enough tools to set the timer back for quite a bit if you do it right. This can be done by destroying alien facilities dedicated to the project or advancing in the main plot. Even without focusing too much on the 'Avatar Project'( or rather especially if you don't) unless it becomes really necessary when the bar completely fills and you are given about a month to set the progress back somehow, it is only really concerning you early on similiar to the other titles of the series where Panic only really mattered early on.  As for the tactical skirmishes; they retain a simple formula: You have a few soldiers who can perform two actions per turn, such as running or shooting. Wether your soldiers miss or hit an enemy depends on a %hit-chance which gets improved if your soldiers are promoted and thus receive better training or if your enemies do not stand in cover but are exposed. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that killing every alien isn't your primary objective. And while it is tempting to go for as many enemies or rewards as possible you have to keep in mind one thing; You will fail and when you do it will ♥♥♥♥ you off. This however is the essence of XCOM; getting your ♥♥♥ kicked and trying to overcome it somehow.   Now you might be wondering; why the hell does the game assume that we lost during XCOM; Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within? This is mostly due to the rather high difficulty of the game itself which hasn't changed in this title.  If at all, the introduction of turn-timers( or rather limiters as you still have an infinite amount of time to plan a turn) and varying enemy AI has made the game even more difficult. You might be thinking; 'WTF are those timers they don't belong into a TBS-game'! While some people keep arguing that strategies are being limited, it really allows for more variety; the game gives you plenty of tools to battle the timer while still being able to perform different approaches. Even then, in most cases the timers are rather generous and with one exception aren't present in story missions. Dealing with them isn't an issue; and even if you find them annoying and out of place there is a mod that removes or tweaks them in the Workshop.Speaking of which;  This game has integrated mod support and user-friendly ini-files, meaning that modding is quite easy and already being quite well only a few weeks after release, just imagine the possibilities in a few months.  A major issue as of now however, is the flawed optimization of the game. This seems rather weird considering that it has been developed as PC-only. Thus I would suggest waiting a few more weeks until these issues are fixed as there are quite some issues; save corruption on the last mission( which bars you from finishing the game after 20+ hours), poor graphical optimization( which seems to be especially noticable on HIGH END computers) and some bugs( such as seeing enemies through walls/floors) are all rather annoying.  As for the game's story: While XCOM 2 puts a bit more focus on the main story than EU/EW, it still isn't the game's main selling point. Additionally, quite some interesting plot-options have been left out. Just as its predecessor however, it features tons of customization options for all of your soldiers - all kinds of different helmets, armors, haircuts, tatoos, custom biographies, names, looks and even an option to import characters to your friends games and vice versa due to the character pool option. The most interesting part of this is however, that this gives you an extremely strong attachment to your troops and both makes you feel really happy when they get out alive in a hairy situation and really sad when they meet their inevitable fate. As such the game is able to write quite some interesting stories just through its gameplay. This is a rather unique feature that does give the game quite a decent storytelling if you're willing to roleplay it to such an extent. As quite a bit of its story comes from the gameplay, it always feels like a fresh experience to start a new game and beat( or fail) the campaign yet again. Which is something that the game really focuses on.  So is this game good and recommendable? Yes, most definitly, while it still suffers some issues which are hopefully soon taken care of, It is a great deal of fun if you're lucky enough not to run into most of these issues. Just keep in mind that it IS difficult and you will have to put in some effort to become good at it. Additionally, it does differ from most strategy games due to its turn based combat, so keep that in mind. As for the stoy, if you're someone who really likes role-playing multiple characters you might like this game, but if you prefer a well written and extensive story you should look somewhere else. All in all, this is a great game which will only improve with the time to come due to mods. All hail the PC-masterrace and our glorious king Gaben!",x,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,0
